# Socket.IO Serverless Alternative

## The Problem
Socket.IO with WebSockets doesn't work well with Vercel's serverless functions because:
- Serverless functions are stateless and short-lived
- Socket.IO requires persistent connections
- Vercel functions have execution time limits

## Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: Use Polling Transport (Current Implementation)
- ✅ Works with serverless
- ✅ Real-time updates (with slight delay)
- ❌ Higher bandwidth usage
- ❌ Slightly higher latency

### Option 2: Use Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- ✅ Works with serverless
- ✅ Lower latency than polling
- ✅ Better for one-way communication
- ❌ More complex to implement

### Option 3: Use External WebSocket Service
- ✅ True real-time communication
- ✅ Lower latency
- ❌ Additional cost
- ❌ More complex setup

## Current Implementation
The app now uses Socket.IO with polling transport, which should work with Vercel's serverless functions.

## Testing the Fix
1. Deploy the updated configuration
2. Test room creation and joining
3. Verify timer synchronization works
4. Check browser console for Socket.IO errors

## Future Improvements
For better performance, consider:
1. Moving to a dedicated WebSocket service (like Pusher, Ably, or Socket.IO Cloud)
2. Implementing Server-Sent Events for timer updates
3. Using a traditional server deployment (Railway, Render, etc.) for Socket.IO
